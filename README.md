# Decentralized Renewable Energy Trading

This project implements a blockchain-based platform that enables peer-to-peer renewable energy trading. The system allows energy producers and consumers to engage in direct electricity exchange, optimizing local energy usage, reducing transmission losses, and accelerating the transition to renewable energy sources.

## Core Components

1. **Producer Registration Contract**
    - Records detailed information about renewable energy generation sources
    - Verifies and certifies the type and capacity of generation equipment
    - Tracks historical production data and generation patterns
    - Establishes producer identities and reputation within the network

2. **Consumption Metering Contract**
    - Tracks real-time energy usage by consumers
    - Integrates with smart meters to provide verifiable consumption data
    - Creates immutable record of energy consumption patterns
    - Supports dynamic pricing based on demand and availability

3. **Peer-to-Peer Trading Contract**
    - Facilitates direct energy exchange between producers and consumers
    - Implements automated matching algorithms for optimal energy allocation
    - Handles secure payment settlement between parties
    - Creates transparent marketplace for local energy resources

4. **Grid Balancing Contract**
    - Manages overall stability of the decentralized energy network
    - Coordinates demand response during peak usage periods
    - Optimizes distribution of energy across the grid
    - Integrates with traditional grid infrastructure when necessary
